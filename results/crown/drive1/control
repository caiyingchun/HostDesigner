LINK drivea driveb testdrive


This example illustrates the use of testdrive.  It produces two files named
out_testa.hdo and out_testb.hdo

Viewing the contents of these files with a molecular graphics software, for
example, pcmodel, provides a way to ensure that the drive specifications are
working as desired.
